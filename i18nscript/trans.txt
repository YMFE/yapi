Efficient, easy-to-use, powerful API management platform
Designed to provide developers, product and testers with a more elegant interface management service.

A management platform for API developers
YApi makes interface development easier and more efficient, makes interface management more readable and maintainable, and makes teamwork more rational.
Project Management
Provide basic project grouping, project management, interface management features
interface management
friendly interface documentation , based on websocket collaborative interface editing and multi-user class postman test tool , so that multi-user collaboration doubles the development efficiency .
Based on Mockjs, simple to use and powerful
Powerful Mock Service
All the Mock services you want are here.
Mock rules
The ease of writing interfaces by learning a few simple Mock template rules will greatly increase the efficiency of defining interfaces. And don't worry about writing mock data: all data can be generated randomly in real time.
Generated mock data can be used directly with ajax requests or through server proxies (without changing a single line of project code)

Team leader (* N)
- Create project

- Managing Developers and Members

- Group creation is not allowed
- Do not allow changes to group or project information
Flattened management model
The logic of interface management is complex and the frequency of operation is high, which will seriously slow down the production efficiency.
YAPI introduces the idea of flat management mode into the rights management of the product. Permissions are assigned to a number of team leaders, and the super administrator only needs to manage the team leader, which actually manages YAPI's major groups and projects." Team Leader". The Team Leader is responsible for the subgroup or project and is usually the BU Leader/Project Leader.
